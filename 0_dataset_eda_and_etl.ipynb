    "In this project, you will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, you'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",

    "If you completed the first term of this program, you will be familiar with the first part of this project, from the unsupervised learning project. The versions of those two datasets used in this project will include many more features and has not been pre-cleaned. You are also free to choose whatever approach you'd like to analyzing the data rather than follow pre-determined steps. In your work on this project, make sure that you carefully document your steps and decisions, since your main deliverable for this project will be a blog post reporting your findings."

    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. Use the information from the first two files to figure out how customers (\"CUSTOMERS\") are similar to or differ from the general population at large (\"AZDIAS\"), then use your analysis to make predictions on the other two files (\"MAILOUT\"), predicting which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company.\n",

    "The \"CUSTOMERS\" file contains three extra columns ('CUSTOMER_GROUP', 'ONLINE_PURCHASE', and 'PRODUCT_GROUP'), which provide broad information about the customers depicted in the file. The original \"MAILOUT\" file included one additional column, \"RESPONSE\", which indicated whether or not each recipient became a customer of the company. For the \"TRAIN\" subset, this column has been retained, but in the \"TEST\" subset it has been removed; it is against that withheld column that your final predictions will be assessed in the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, all of the remaining columns are the same between the three data files. For more information about the columns depicted in the files, you can refer to two Excel spreadsheets provided in the workspace. [One of them](./DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx) is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category. [The other](./DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx) is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we've provided some initial code to load in the first two datasets. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project that they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so an additional argument in the [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call has been included to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the datasets, it may take some time for them to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice when the data is loaded in that a warning message will immediately pop up. Before you really start digging into the modeling and analysis, you're going to need to perform some cleaning. Take some time to browse the structure of the data and look over the informational spreadsheets to understand the data values. Make some decisions on which features to keep, which features to drop, and if any revisions need to be made on data formats. It'll be a good idea to create a function with pre-processing steps, since you'll need to clean all of the datasets before you work with them."

    "## Part 0: Initial Discussion of my Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first section I am going to prepare the azdias dataset ready for the Customer Segmentation Report section.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are high dimensionality datasets so before model the data using an unsupervised learning model I am first going to want to reduce the dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I am going to use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) which will transform the dataset into its principle variant components. PCA is a continuous feature method that is performed on centred and normalised data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore prior to peforming PCA I first need to have a dataset that is made up of numerical, normalised data with no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "My overall strategy for creating this clean dataset is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert any categorical variables to continuous numerical variables\n",
    "* Determine a strategy for handling missing values\n",
    "* Normalise all numerical \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of additional considerations in these steps that is worth discussing before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalising numerical features\n",
    "\n",
    "It would seem obvious, but all numerical features should have a clear ranking. i.e. for the given feature each incremental or decremental value represents an increase or decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 = Low\n",
    "2 = Med\n",
    "3 = High\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "1 = High\n",
    "2 = Med\n",
    "3 = High\n",
    "\n",
    "If however a numerical feature doesn't have a clear ranking, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 = Med\n",
    "2 = Low\n",
    "3 = High\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when normalising this feature issues will arise with PCA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bearing this in mind, I am going to take extra care to understand the the numerical variables and verify there is a rank ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two essential documents supplied by Arvato to help with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "DIAS Attributes - Values 2017\n",
    "DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "Since categorical features need to be converted to ranked, numerical features the first question that arises is whether the categorical features is ordinal. If it is, then it should be a straightforward conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "It it is not ordinal then one-hot encoding could be considered. This should only be used if the feature is of low cardinality else this introduces sparse features into the dataset which will impact PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values will need to be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to drop rows that have missing values. This may seem a logical strategy if there are rows with lots of missing values, however this would assume that all features are of equal value: If a row is missing lots of low interest feature values but retains many high interest feature values then it may be fine to keep the row. The challenge there however is in discerning what would be considered a high interest feature. Some inferences could be made but this would be discretionary. Unfortunately we are not in contact with Arvato so no further clarity can be gained in understanding the collected features more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to impute values. This could be better than dropping the rows since information is retained. However, it runs the risk of adding information that wasn't there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In evaluating the missing values, the question to keep in mind is: Why are these values missing? \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps there was no suitable category or value for that individual for that feature. In which case, imputing a value is a dangerous strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know how this dataset was amalgamated. Perhaps if the dataset was joined from various subtables, NaN were introduced. In which case, imputing values could be an ok strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, imputing 'good' values can be computationally expensive using something like a knn imputer and right now I am resource limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think my best strategy will be to remove rows where there are a significant number of missing values and do simple imputation on non-missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step is to refer to the DIAS documents and assess each feature. There are 366 features so I need to strike a balance between analysis and managing my project time. My main interest is in considering the points i've discussed above which are in summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are numerical features ranked?\n",
    "* Are categorical features ordinal or low cardinality?\n",
    "* Does anything else stand out about these features that might be worth keeping in mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section will be a discussion of these points."

    "# Part 0: Getting to know all 366 features\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is going to be fairly hands-off with regards to specific analysis of the data within the dataset and is instead going to focus on understanding the features and the value they contribute, keeping in mind I intend to normalise all features in preparation for EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaching it this way, I can save myself some time with EDA and later processing by dropping any features that I do not consider good.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am now going to proceed through the DIAS sheets and analyse each feature. By the end of this section I aim to have a cleaner dataset that I can move forward with, with some Exploratory Data Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will be broken down into a discussion of observations with some actions points at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "I note many of the features that are numerical have a numerical value that signifies the information is 'unknown'. This can be thought of as a known 'uknown' unlike a NaN which would be an uknown 'uknown'. Often the value is 0 or -1, although sometimes it is the max value depending on how the feature is ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "*D19_GESAMT_ONLINE_DATUM, ranks from highest=0 - lowest=9. uknown=10\n",
    "*BALLRAUM - ranks from lowest=1 - highest=7. unknown=0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite problematic for normalising the data because the uknown in effect means it could be any value but by positioning it as the lowest or highest numerical value gives meaning to where there is no meaning. This will distort the normalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, being a quantified uknown doesn't give us a sense of how populated these features actually are. Therefore, these uknown values should be addressed in the same way as NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features are effectively Boolean, taking 1 of 2 values. e.g. gender, (east|west). I think min-max feature scaling will be appropriate for all these features with any known uknown values being centred at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAMEO_DEUINTIL_2015 - This is a perculiar ranked, numerical feature that seems to combine two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wealth i.e. Wealthy/Prosperous/Comfortable\n",
    "Life stage i.e. Pre-Family/Young Couples/Families\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this is that Life stage is conflated with wealth in the same rank. This feature should be split. I should check if any other features have this perculiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some more perculiar features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* D19_*_RZ\n",
    "\n",
    "These 11 features describe transaction activity based on a product group with the following 8 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. no transaction known\n",
    "1. Multibuyer 0-12 months\n",
    "2. Doublebuyer 0-12 months\n",
    "3. Singlebuyer 0-12 months\n",
    "4. Multi/Doublebuyer 13-24 months\n",
    "5. Singlebuyer 13-24 months\n",
    "6. Buyer > 24 months\n",
    "7. Prospects > 24 months\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel these features could be split into two clearer categories however it is unclear to me the relationship between the first set of categories: (Multibuyer,Doublebuyer,Singlebuyer) and the second: (Buyer,Prospects). I can find no more information about these in the supplied information. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think I'm going to leave these features as they are since there is a general ranking structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "TITEL_KZ is odd\n",
    "\n",
    "-1. unknown\n",
    "0. unknown\n",
    "1. Dr.\n",

    "3. Prof.\n",
    "4. Prof. Dr.\n",
    "5. other\n",
    "\n",
    "The description is: 'Flag whether this person holds an academic title'.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't understand what is meant by Dr and then Dr.Dr, though I think diffrentiating between holding an academic titles and not holding one is useful. I'm going to analyse this feature further. I think I could bin groups 1-5 and -1-0 and min-max scale them and this feature could then be a useful dimension in my PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action Points\n",
    "\n",
    "After analysing both documents fully I have the following specific action breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, many of the features are ranked and numerical that will be easy to normalise. The quantifying of uknown values as a min or max is an issue however. These should be set to NaN and imputed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I need to verify whether any features are present in the dataset that are missing from the information sheet. If I cannot discern the meaning or structure of these undocumented features then they will need to be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of further actions for specific features.\n",

    "##### Features to analyse further\n",
    "\n",
    "* CJT_GESAMTTYP - Looks like it should be one-hot encoded, inspect further\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Features to drop\n",
    "\n",
    "* CAMEO_DEU_2015 - high cardinality, non-ordinal categorical\n",
    "\n",
    "The following were numerical features that had no clear ranking. In effect, categorical features. These could be one-hot encoded but it was felt this would introduce sparse features into an already high dimensionality dataset. After evaluating their significance, it was decided they should be dropped.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Features to min-max scale\n",
    "\n",
    "These are features that have only 2 values (notwithstanding NaN/uknown). One value will be assigned -1, the other value will be 1. The assignment choice is arbitrary.\n",
